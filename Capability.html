1. I think my sense of challenge can help the planning and management department of this company.
Even during the period when everyone went back home, I developed my strength by whipping myself to have the virtues of a soldier while living in school as usual. The challenge of sincerity became the basis of college life and resulted in achieving goals in areas such as physical strength, study, and TOEIC.

2. I prepared a certificate for self-development and made a note to manage insufficient time while doing club activities. Thanks to the notebook that recorded my daily life and organized what I learned that day, I was able to learn faster than before without forgetting what I had to memorize. By achieving my goals in this way, I was able to obtain first-degree certificates for trade English, international trade history, and computer utilization. Also, while organizing what happened during the day, I was able to analyze what I had to fix and improve in relationships with people. Having difficulty presenting opinions, I learned how to speak with my conviction, and I was able to present more active improvement measures to the club meetings every week.

If I get a job at this company based on my sense of challenge, organization, and analysis, I will constantly present management directions and strategies as a new plan. Rather, we will suggest a way using the fact that it is difficult to inform the brand to ordinary consumers.
