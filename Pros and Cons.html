The foreign language high school, which I entered to experience the wide world, was not only an opportunity to experience foreign culture, but also a time when I was able to grow inside myself through boarding life.

"Do your best in everything".
<p style="margin-top:25px;"></p>
I naturally realized the importance of diligence, sincerity, and responsibility from childhood, following my father, who worked for a company for more than 25 years, and my mother, who prepares breakfast carefully at 6 a.m. every day. I was able to challenge myself to a foreign language high school based on my parents' words that I should not give up and do my best. In high school, I was able to promote cultural relativism through socialization with foreign teachers from each country.

In addition, it took a long time to adapt to the new environment in boarding life, but I was able to grow inside by developing consideration and cooperation. I realized the benefits of living in the dormitory and wanted to continue my group life even when I went to college.

I naturally liked the school corps, which was a strong, decisive and thorough organization. I was able to join the school corps after a lot of training and tests. Through this opportunity, I was proud that I developed my sense of challenge and tried for a new career. I couldn't be the female military officer I dreamed of due to accidental accidents, but I think the past days when I tried and devoted myself to becoming a school corps were never in vain, and I think it was a valuable time to personally experience that only passion for goals and constant efforts could give me the answer.
