I will be an employee who understands and cares about each other.

I started boarding in high school and spent time with my friends, realized that the starting point of all disputes was trivial, so I developed a careful attitude. It was a high school life with a lot of academic stress, but quarreling with friends was an opportunity to get closer than stress. I was able to resolve the dispute by understanding the environment and personality in which he grew up, and I was able to see my inner self that I did not understand. As the years of boarding went up, the mind to understand the other person was ahead of the selfish mind, and now I can guarantee that there has never been a problem with human relationships.
You will work with your colleagues looking at the same goal, but it is expected that you will often be more aware of your competitors than your colleagues as you pass through a rapidly changing and competing society. If I can work as a new employee of this company, I would like to work thinking of my colleague as a comrade rather than as a competitor. I want to be a new employee who learns by properly accepting the opinions of many people.

I was able to learn the attitude of active followers while working as an associated club with nearly 200 people. Since it was a club that started late, there were many juniors who were the central executives. Even though I am a junior, I have developed an attitude of listening to, learning, and respecting the opinions of experienced juniors rather than presenting myself to the juniors who run the club by claiming to be central executives. Since then, when I was located as an executive, I have been able to actively participate in club activities by managing personnel and managing time and people.

My experiences have made it possible for me to get along well regardless of any situation. If I join the company, I will be an employee who maintains the team atmosphere so that everyone can create a culture of respect and consideration for each other. Also, I will try to be an active follower and become an employee who is not afraid of learning. Even if conflicts and incomprehensible difficulties arise, we will try not to avoid them unconditionally, but to become an employee who finds consensus and grows in a relationship of understanding and consideration.
